# Bare MDE :bear:

Basic markdown editor, based on CodeJar, packed as Preact component. Made for 
my pet projects.

Probably, not the embeddable markdown editor you're looking for.

- As minimal, as possible (less than 60 Kb when built)
- Browser native spellcheck
- Fully isolated preview panel, which leads to perfect one-to-one preview (iframe)
- Split preview, full width preview
- Sync preview scroll (more or less accurate)
- Basic formatting buttons
- Passed by upper-level component:
   * Markdown render function 
   * Save function
   * External preview function

This repo is a bit messy. If you think, you would use this component, 
file me an issue.
